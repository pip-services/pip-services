# <img src="https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services/blob/master/design/Logo.png" alt="Pip.Services Logo" style="max-width:30%"> <br/> Library of reusable microservices

Microservices architectural style is quickly becoming popular among software developers.
But variety of languages, platforms and frameworks, as well as lack of standards
make it difficult to find ready-to-use components that you can drop and use into your system.
SaaS services offer fairly good solution to that problem. But they also come with difficult tradeoffs.
You have to give up control over functionality and data. You may pay extra to SaaS providers.
You are limited to features that are given to you and so on. Moreover, not everything can and shall
run on the cloud. In that case SaaS services is not a good help.

Pip.Services team offers a different solution - a collection of reusable microservices
that you can take, modify and deploy as a part of your own system. You regain full control over
functionality and operations. You are able to pick any type of persistence storage,
infrastructural components like logging, performance and health monitoring. You can deploy
microservices on virtually any platform and use them from any programming language.

That level of flexibility becomes possible due to [componentized microservice architecture](design/Architecture.md).
You can simply take a microservice, pick the necessary components for persistence, logging, caching, discovery, 
performance counters, service endpoints and client connectors and describe it in [microservice configuration](usage/Configuration.md).
After that microservice is ready to be deployed in the target development or production environments.
